### Project Outline: AddiBase - Enhancing Additive Manufacturing with IDTA Submodel Template and AI-driven Cognitive Production Control

**Introduction**

Additive manufacturing using metal powders for certified parts consists of complex sub-processes with many influencing parameters. The current practice of storing data in various formats leads to inefficiencies and errors in data acquisition. The AddiBase project aims to extend the existing Manufacturing Execution System with a material and process database for the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. This database will be integrated with an IDTA Submodel Template for interoperability, allowing standardized data representation and seamless communication between different LPBF machines and systems. The project will also develop user-friendly Apps and a User Interface to facilitate data acquisition, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, we will explore the integration of generative AI and object-oriented AI systems for cognitive production control and problem-solving to enhance manufacturing processes.

**Project Objectives**

- Extend the Manufacturing Execution System with a material and process database, incorporating the IDTA Submodel Template for LPBF machines.
- Develop user-friendly Apps and a customizable User Interface to enable easy data acquisition and visualization for end-users.
- Implement automatic data import from existing servers to streamline data transfer and ensure comprehensive data coverage.
- Create an online catalog with detailed production profiles and parameter information for LPBF machines, enabling manufacturers to select suitable machines for their specific requirements.
- Integrate the AddiBase system with existing production planning systems to enhance production scheduling and resource allocation.
- Explore and incorporate generative AI and object-oriented AI systems for cognitive production control, predictive maintenance, and problem-solving.
- Leverage evolving AI capabilities over the next two years to enhance production efficiency, quality, and adaptability.

**Importance and Benefits**

- **Centralized Data Repository**: The integrated material and process database streamline data storage, reducing redundancy and errors.
- **Interoperability**: The IDTA Submodel Template fosters seamless communication and data exchange between LPBF machines and different systems, improving collaboration and data flow.
- **Online Catalog**: The online catalog empowers manufacturers to make informed decisions on selecting appropriate LPBF machines, optimizing production capabilities.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The Apps' data visualization and analysis capabilities enable manufacturers to identify trends, anomalies, and potential improvements, fostering data-driven decision-making.
- **Enhanced Production Planning**: Integration with existing production planning systems improves production scheduling and resource allocation, leading to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- **Cognitive Production Control**: The integration of generative AI and object-oriented AI systems enables advanced production control, predictive maintenance, and problem-solving, improving overall manufacturing performance.
